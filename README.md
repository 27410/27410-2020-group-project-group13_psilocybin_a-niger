# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 13 - Biosynthesis of Psilocybin in <i>Aspergillus niger</i>

## Project summary (<300 words)
This project is aimed at introducing the heterologous biosynthetic pathway for psilocybin production in an existing GSM of *A. niger*, and thereafter use computational methods to identify which changes to the model could optimize production. Cofactor swap optimization revealed swapping cofactor specificity of two reactions in the model from NADPH to NADH could potentially improve theoretical yield of psilocybin. Investigation of gene regulation targets revealed several reactions that could be either upregulated or downregulated to improve psilocybin production flux. Two of the enzymes targeted for upregulation are in the shikimate pathway, which leads to the psilocybin precursor tryptophan, and were also shown to improve psilocybin production in previous studies. Several new gene prediction targets for upregulation, including methylation reactions, were found that could lead to promising results in follow up studies on the effect of their upregulation. Media optimization showed that addition of YEPD to the media led to a slight reduction in yield, but an increase in the production flux of the last step in psilocybin biosynthesis by a factor of 17.

A summary of what we achieved in this project: 
- Computed a production strategy of heterologous psilocybin production in *A. niger* using a GSM model, and employed various  computational methods to improve theoretical psilocybin yield.
- Computed gene regulation targets
- Investigated co-factor swapping 
- Media optimization
