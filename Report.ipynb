    "#### Applications of the product\n",
    "Psilocybin is a bioactive alkaloid derived from several mushrooms of the genus Psilocybe (James, Robertshaw, Hoskins and Sessa, 2020). The use of the compound can be dated as back as to 2000 BC in north africa and mexico and has been used  for recreational and spiritual purposes because of its psychedelic effects. Psilocybin can cross the blood brain barrier and act on the central nerve system, and alter mood, consciousness and cognition(Mahmood, 2013). \n",
    "Recently, Psilocybin has demonstrated efficient treatment of several different disorders including, alcoholism, tobacco addiction, depression and anxiety. At the time of writing 47 clinical studies are being conducted with a majority of them being focused on treating depression(Mahmood, 2013); (Search of: psilocybin - List Results - ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020). Some of the present studies are also researching the potential neurodegenerative effect of psilocybin in treatment of Alzheimer's disease. If these clinical trials show successful results psilocybin could become a potential player in the pharmaceutical market. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation of market potential\n",
    "The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of the psychedelic drugs market is forecasted at 16.3%,  with applications mainly in mental health. The psychedelic drugs market is expected to reach USD 6.85 billion by 2027 from USD 2.08 billion in 2019 (Psychedelic Drugs Market 2020). Although the global antidepressants market was valued at USD 13.75 billion at 2016, the CAGR is only projected to be 2.1% from the period of 2017 to 2023, which shows that the psychedelic drugs market could soon be a lucrative alternative to the established antidepressants market (Data Bridge Market Research, 2020).\n",
    "The growth in these markets is fueled by a growing demand for safer alternative therapies to antidepressants for anxiety and depression and other mental health issues, growing evidence of it's efficacy for treating mental health disorders, and the approval for several clinical trials (Publishing, 2020; Usona Institute, 2020). Market potential is also supported by the approval in the US for other psychedelic therapies like the ketamine analogue made by the large pharmaceutical company Johnson & Jonhson (US FDA, 2020). Although psilocybin can be extracted from various psilocybe mushroom species, the psilocybin and psilocin concentration is 0.2-1% of dry weight, and is therefore not a commercially viable option. Therefore the continual growth in the psilocybin market will depend on other methods of production, including the use of cell factories (N. Milne et al, 2020). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Biosynthetic pathway/genes\n",
    "The biosynthesis of psilocybin involves enzymatic steps by the following enzymes: L-tryptophan decarboxylase(PsiD), Tryptamine 4-monooxygenase(PsiH), 4-hydroxytryptamine kinase(PsiK) and Psilocybin synthase(PsiM)(Fricke, Blei and Hoffmeister, 2017). The first step in the pathway is catalyzed by the enzymes PsiD and PsiH. Here the precursor L‐tryptophan is decarboxylated by PsiD into tryptamine and  then the monooxygenase PsiH hydroxylates the C-4, yielding 4-hydroxytryptamine. The second step in pathway is mediated by a PsiK and here 4-hydroxytryptophan is phosphorylated into norbaeocystin (4-hydroxytryptophan-4-phosohat). The last step of the biosynthesis is made by PsiM which methylates the amine group twice making it a tertiary amine. The last methylation step is regenerated through the S-adenosylmethionine(SAM) salvage cycle and is therefore important for the production of psilocybin(Fricke, Blei and Hoffmeister, 2017). Lastly, Psilocybin can spontanously degraded into psilocyn which can pose dificulties in down stream processing. Furhtermore, the reaction can also be reversed so Psilocin is phosphorylated by PsiK."

    "## 1.2 Literature review of the cell factory\n",
    "#### The factory used in this report - introduction to Aspergillus niger\n",
    "In this report we have chosen to work with cell factory - Aspergillus niger (*A. niger*). Below is shown a picture of *A. niger* grown on different media. It shows the many forms *A. niger* is able to take. These forms or morphologies give *A. niger* advantages and disadvantages. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Biosynthetic pathway of Psilocybin](Pics/Aspergillus.png \"Aspergillus on different media\") \n",
    "\n",
    "Fig 2. *A. niger* grown on Yeast Extract Peptone Dextrose (YPD), Transformation Media (TM), Creatine Sucrose Agar (CREA) and Czepek Yeast Extract Agar (CYA). <i>Pro tip: the picture is alot nicer if you use the white jupyterlab theme</i>. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### General advantages\n",
    "*A. niger* has a reputation for expression of products of industrial and commercial interest, such as proteins, enzymes and secondary metabolites (SMs), including therapeutics (Richter et al., 2014). Compared to other conventional production hosts,  *A. niger* has a secretion capacity that far exceeds any other (Ten Buren et al., 2014). *A. niger*, like other filamentous fungi, arranges its cells into a thread-like network called mycelia. This ability is used to colonize substrates in nature with the least amount of biomass needed. This inherent ability makes filamentous fungi especifically good at secreting acids and digestive proteins to their environment which has been exploited by biotechnology for centuries. Some of the advantages are the amount of secreted product by also the fact that it is secreted which limits down-stream processes and costs. This highly sophisticated export machinery in the hyphal tips is called the “spitzenkörper”. The spitzenkörper is a collection of vesicles containing proteins, metabolites and other intracellular components to be secreted by the fungus into the extracellular space. *A niger* is great at making secondary metabolites at an affordable price which is emphasized by the fact that it produces more citric acid than by fermentation than any other production of organic acids by fermentation (V. Meyer et al, 2016). Hijacking the spitzenkörper could allow for increased product secretion to the medium and therefore also increase the product accessibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General disadvantages\n",
    "In an industrial setting, filamentous fungi branches inside the fermentation tank. This increases viscosity and limits oxygen transfer. Ultimately this can stress the cells and in some cases it can lead to decreased productivity (Arnau, Yaver and Hjort, 2020). Some other disadvantages are found in the fact that *A. niger* is less studied than the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, despite being an industrial workhorse. \n",
    "\n",
    "Less genetic engineering tools are available for *A. niger*. However, this is being addressed and the state of the art genetic engineering tool Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) along with the CRISPR associated proteins, Cas9 and Cpf1, has recently been adapted and to the repertoar of tools (Nødvig, Nielsen, Kogle and Mortensen, 2015; Vanegas, Jarczynska, Strucko and Mortensen, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Suitability of the cell factory for the product\n",
    "The suitability of the cell factory to produce Psilocybin lies in the advantages described above which include it’s inherent ability to secrete SM’s exemplified by it’s citric acid and Lovastatin production (V. Meyer et al, 2016). By using *A. niger* as a production platform, the downstream processes, which are one of the biggest costs in the production of pharmaceuticals, could be limited. The outcome is that the whole project becomes more realistic and profitable which is what the investors of this project would be interested in. Another strength of A. niger is that it most likely is able to express a functioning p450 required in the second step of Psilocybin biosynthesis, since its close relative, *Aspergillus nidulans*, is able to express fully functioning enzymes. This stands in steep contrast to E. coli which is limited to bypass this part of the pathway with expensive substrate because it cannot express p450’s (N. Milne et al, 2020). \n",
    "\n",
    "The secretory strength of *A. niger* is, at the same time, a pitfall since it secretes additional SM’s to the medium which could increase downstream process costs. An alternative organism to this extent could be *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* since it secretes a limited amount of SM’s. \n"

    "## 2. Problem definition\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently psilocybin production depends on chemical synthesis, which is a costly and laborious production process (Milne et al., 2020). In this report we want to examine the feasibility of a different production mechanism/route for psilocybin production, one employing heterologous production in *A. niger*. We will perform this assessment in silico using the genome scale metabolic model (iJB1325) for the industrially relevant strain ATCC1015 (Brandl et al., 2018). The psilocybin pathway shown in figure 1 will be added to the GSM, after which we will use different computational methods to identify metabolic changes (as well as other types of changes) that will improve the production of psilocybin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a cell factory capable of producing Psilocybin will open a new routes for treatment of severe disseases and therefore a solid business. \n",
    "In order to have a successful production platform, the fermentation process needs to result in adequate yields, productivity and titer. First of all, we want to focus on achieving a high yield, which is the most crucial fermentation metric in order to make a viable production. Regardless, we must ensure that the metabolically engineered *A. niger* has a reasonable growth rate and titer, in order for the production to be economically viable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to chemical synthesis, fermentation has the potential to be a more sustainable as well as a more economic manufacturing process, as it does not require extensive use of chemicals (is this correct? regarding extensive use of chemicals), and can potentially utilize a cheap waste product hydrolysate as feedstock (lignocellulosic biomass). With the still increasing human population and the reduction in arable land as a consequence of climate change, using a waste product hydrolysate is of great importance since it is avoiding the issue of indirect land use change.\n"

    "The default media of the model is supplying glucose as well as the most necessary/critical elements. However, fungal fermentation can be run with Yeast Extract Peptone Dextrose (YEPD), in order to optimize growth and production. Therefore, we have added some additional nutrients so the media will mimic the YEPD media, namely the 18 amino acids present in yeast extract, as well as zinc and iron (the trace elements magnesium, manganese, chromium, cobalt, strontium could not be found in the model). Furthermore, the glucose content in the media was increased to 20 (unit). Using the YEPD media the maximum theoretical biomass productivity is increased with a factor 17, while the maximum theoretical productivity of psilocybin production is increased with a factor 19. The maximum theoretical yield using the YEPD media decreases from 0.3079 mmol/mmol (using the basic media) to 0.2993 mmol/mmol. Although this is a small reduction in yield, the YEPD media is still favored, since it brings about a large increase in productivity (both regarding the biomass (OBS tjek om dette er rigtigt Thilde) and the psilocybin production). Furthermore, the required minimal yield in order to run a viable psilocybin manufacturing company is much smaller (maybe need to justify this with numbers, Thilde can make some numbers), making the small reduction in yield rather insignificant. \n",

These two major pathways have been investigated in *S. cerevisiae* and *Psilocybe cubensis*, respectively. Upregulation of the Shikimate pathway has been investigated as a target for increasing tryptophan biosynthesis (N. Milne et al, 2020); more specifically, the first two enzymes of this pathway were overexpressed as a rational engineering approach by N. Milne et al. Our results show that it could be beneficial to overexpress some other parts of the pathway along with the two first enzymes, which could be interesting for further research. \n",
    "\n",
    "The methylation reactions, which includes SAM and SAH, have also been investigated as targets previously, where the SAM salvage was noted as critical to reach high titers of psilocybin (R. Demmler et al, 2020). Our results indicate additional targets that have not been investigated before, i.e. r96 - methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, which could be interesting to study. Furthermore, swapping cofactor specificity of Enoyl-ACP reductase to NADH in r581 could potentially divert NADPH 4-hydroxy-tryptamine synthesis, leading to a higher psilocybin yield. \n",
    "Optimizing the media has been a way of enhancing production for many years. Here it was shown that changing the media computationally from minimal media to YEPD results in increased biomass and psilocybin productivity. Although the media change resulted in a small reduction in yield, the YEPD media is still favored, since it generates a large increase in productivity. Furthermore, the minimum yield required to break even is much smaller, making the small reduction in yield insignificant.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we estimate the minimum yield we need to achieve to break even on the glucose consumption the following calculation is made: If a pilot plant was to be constructed of 5 m3 and a titer of 1g/L was achieved, approximately 250 kg psilocybin could be produced per year. If the selling price is estimated to 750 USD/g an average revenue of 187.5 M USD is achieved. With a glucose price of 250 USD/ton, the minimum yield required is 2.113*10<sup>-1</sup> (mmol  psilocybin)/(mmol glucose). This value is far lower than our present computations (0.2993 mmol psilocybin/mmol carbon sources using YEPD), which could turn out to be profitable. This is without considering the capital investments, employment of full time equivalents, as well as running cost. Also the calculation is based on the price of glucose and not on YEPD media. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the next steps towards implementation is to account for discrepancies in the two *A. niger* ATCC 1015 models iJB1325 and iDU1756. As Upton D. et al. 2020 claims, it could be favorable to fix issues regarding some of the irreversible reactions, the phosphate imbalance, TCA cycle reaction, and the cytosolic citrate synthase that was not found in vivo. The missing parts of the model could lead to wrong predictions or no results when computational methods are applied to the model. In this work there were obstacles in some areas such as dFBA analysis, Optgene prediction and prediction of novel heterologous pathways, which could be blamed on the insufficiencies of the model. Furthermore, as Upton D. et al. 2020 describes it could be advantageous to combine the information from the two models when performing in silico analysis. \n",

    "## 6. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the significant rise in value of the psychedelic drugs market, novel methods of producing psilocybin are needed to determine the most efficient cell-factory host to support the projected future demand. In this project, we have computed a production strategy of heterologous psilocybin production in *A. niger*, using a GSM model, and employed various computational methods to improve theoretical psilocybin yield. Several targets for gene target upregulation were discovered, many of which were not identified for upregulation by N. Milne et al., and therefore offer novel strain designs for follow-up studies. Furthermore, the high theoretical psilocybin yield by utilizing YEPD in the media could allow sufficient psilocybin production on a relatively small scale, and at a low enough cost to ensure that that the product can be sold at a competitive price. A more complete model of *A. niger*, would allow follow up studies to get more reliable results, and also determine whether other computational methods can further improve the theoretical yield. The results of these computations are only theoretical, and therefore must be verified in the laboratory *in vivo* and in a pilot scale study.\n",
