    "#### Applications of the product\n",
    "Psilocybin is a bioactive alkaloid derived from several mushrooms of the genus Psilocybe (James, Robertshaw, Hoskins and Sessa, 2020). The use of the compound can be dated as back as to 2000 BC in north africa and mexico and has been used  for recreational and spiritual purposes because of its psychedelic effects. Psilocybin can cross the blood brain barrier and act on the central nerve system, and alter mood, consciousness and cognition(Mahmood, 2013). \n",
    "Recently, Psilocybin has demonstrated efficient treatment of several different disorders including, alcoholism, tobacco addiction, depression and anxiety. At the time of writing 47 clinical studies are being conducted with a majority of them being focused on treating depression(Mahmood, 2013); (Search of: psilocybin - List Results - ClinicalTrials.gov, 2020). Some of the present studies are also researching the potential neurodegenerative effect of psilocybin in treatment of Alzheimer's disease. If these clinical trials show successful results psilocybin could become a potential player in the pharmaceutical market. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation of market potential\n",
    "The Data Bridge Market Research has recently published a study on the psychedelic drugs market, forecasting its compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.3%, with applications mainly in mental health. The psychedelic drugs market is expected to reach USD 6.85 billion by 2027 from USD 2.08 billion in 2019 (Psychedelic Drugs Market 2020). Although the global antidepressants market was valued at USD 13.78 billion at 2016, the CAGR is only projected to be 2.1% from the period of 2017 to 2023, which shows that the psychedelic drugs market could soon be a lucrative alternative to the established antidepressants market [2].\n",
    "The growth in these markets is fueled by a growing awareness of mental illnesses like depression and anxiety; the lower CAGR for the antidepressant market is likely due to raising concerns about the efficacy and safety profile of antidepressants, and growing number of patent expirations is driving companies to invest in novel alternatives like psychedelics. For example, two widely used anxiety and depression medications Lexapro (escitalopram) and Celexa (citalopram), have been shown to cause side effects such as sweating, sleeplessness, nausea, drowsiness and even bleeding in some cases [3]. Psychedelics, on the other hand, have a high safety profile with only known side effects, and a single treatment of psilocybin lasting 2-6 hours can have anti-depressant and anti-anxiety effects for sometimes several months after treatment. (include safety profile here). Aside from treating mental illness, psilocybin has been shown in limited studies to aid individuals in coping with cancer-related distress and overcoming substance abuse problems (Johnson, 2018). Although psilocybin can be extracted from various psilocybe mushroom species, the psilocybin and psilocin concentration is 0.2-1% of dry weight, and is therefore not a commercially viable option (N. Milne et al, 2020). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Biosynthetic pathway/gene\n",
    "The biosynthesis of psilocybin involves enzymatic steps by the following enzymes: PsiD, PsiH,PsiK and PsiM (Fricke, Blei and Hoffmeister, 2017). The first step in the pathway is catalyzed by the enzymes PsiD and PsiH. Here the precursor L‐tryptophan is decarboxylated by PsiD into tryptamine and  then the monooxygenase PsiH hydroxylates the C-4, yielding 4-hydroxytryptamine. The second step in pathway is mediated by a PsiK and here 4-hydroxytryptophan is phosphorylated into norbaeocystin (4-hydroxytryptophan-4-phosohat). The last step of the biosynthesis is made by PsiM which methylates the amine group twice making it a tertiary amine. The last methylation step is regenerated through the SAM salvage cycle and is therefore important for the production of psilocybin(Fricke, Blei and Hoffmeister, 2017).  "

    "#### The factory used in this report - introduction to Aspergillus niger\n",
    "In this report we have chosen to work with cell factory - Aspergillus niger (A. niger). Below is shown a picture of A. niger grown on different media. It shows the many forms A. niger is able to take. These forms or morphologies give A. niger advantages and disadvantages. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### General advantages\n",
    "A. niger has a great reputation for expression of products of industrial and commercial interest, such as proteins, enzymes and secondary metabolites (SMs), including therapeutics and drugs(Richter et al., 2014). A. niger is also commonly used for expression of heterologous proteins.\n",
    "A. niger has a sophisticated export machinery in the hyphal tips called “spitzenkörper”. The spitzenkörper is a collection of vesicles containing proteins, metabolites and other intracellular components to be secreted by the fungus into the extracellular space and can be hijacked to export products of interest to decrease downstream processing costs.Aspergillus niger is very good at making secondary metabolites at a affordable price which is emphazised by the fact that it produces more citric acid than by fermentation than any other procution of organic acids by fermentation (V. Meyer et al, 2016). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### General disadvantages\n",
    "In an industrial setting, filamentous fungi branch into the fermentation tank. This increases viscosity and limits oxygen transfer. Ultimately this can stress the cells and in some cases it can lead to decreased productivity. Some other disadvantages are found in the fact that A. niger despite being an industrial workhorse it is also less studied than the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A niger also produces more unwanted metabolites than S. cerevisiae, which can make downstream processing more cumbersome. Less genetic engineering tools are available for optimizing production of the A. niger.  However, this is being addressed and the state of the art genetic engineering tool, CRISPR, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, with the CRISPR associated proteins, Cas9 and Cpf1, has recently been adapted and to the repertoar of tools (Nødvig, Nielsen, Kogle and Mortensen, 2015);(Vanegas, Jarczynska, Strucko and Mortensen, 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Suitability of the cell factory for the product\n",
    "The Aspergillus (ascomycete) and Psilocybe (basidiomycete) genuses are close relatives in the fungal kingdom. This makes A. niger a possible great candidate for hosting the psilocybin pathway. As mentioned above, A. niger has a great secretory pathway utilizing the spitzenkörper. Hijacking the spitzenkörper could allow for increased product secretion to the supernatant and therefore also increase the product accessibility."

    "## 2. Problem definition (<300 words)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently psilocybin production depends on chemical synthesis, which is a costly and laborious production process (Milne et al., 2020). In this report we want to examine the feasibility of a different production mechanism/route for psilocybin production, one employing heterologous production in A. niger. We will perform this assessment in silico using the genome scale metabolic model (iJB1325) for the industrially relevant strain ATCC1015 (Brandl et al., 2018). The psilocybin pathway shown in figure 1 will be added to the GSM, after which we will use different computational methods to identify metabolic changes (as well as other types of changes) that will improve the production of psilocybin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a cell factory capable of producing Psilocybin will open a new routes for treatment of severe disseases and therefore a solid business. \n",
    "In order to have a successful production platform, the fermentation process needs to result in adequate yields, productivity and titer. First of all, we want to focus on achieving a high yield, which is the most crucial fermentation metric in order to make a viable production. Regardless, we must ensure that the metabolically engineered A. niger has a reasonable growth rate and titer, in order for the production to be economically viable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to chemical synthesis, fermentation has the potential to be a more sustainable as well as a more economic manufacturing process, as it does not require extensive use of chemicals (is this correct? regarding extensive use of chemicals), and can potentially utilize a cheap waste product hydrolysate as feedstock (lignocellulosic biomass). With the still increasing human population and the reduction in arable land as a consequence of climate change, using a waste product hydrolysate is of great importance since it is avoiding the issue of indirect land use change.\n"

Memote does this by running the two stoiochiometric models through a series of tests based on the current community standard.(https://memote.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). The low score was expected due to the high complexity of fungal genomes compared to prokaryotes. Based on A. niger genome data available from KEGG, the gene coverages of the ATCC 1015 and CBS 513.88 models were 1325/10532 (12.6%) and 1373/10532 (13.0%). However, the total reactions\n",

    "The default media of the model is supplying glucose as well as the most necessary/critical elements. However, fungal fermentation can be run with Yeast Extract Peptone Dextrose (YEPD), in order to optimize growth and production. Therefore, we have added some additional nutrients so the media will mimic the YEPD media, namely the 18 amino acids present in yeast extract, as well as zinc and iron (the trace elements magnesium, manganese, chromium, cobalt, strontium could not be found in the model). Furthermore, the glucose content in the media was increased to 20 (unit). Using the YEPD media the maximum theoretical biomass productivity is increased with a factor 17, while the maximum theoretical productivity of psilocybin production is increased with a factor 19. The maximum theoretical yield using the YEPD media decreases from 0.3079 mmol/mmol (using the basic media) to 0.2993 mmol/mmol. Although this is a small reduction in yield, the YEPD media is still favored, since it brings about a large increase in productivity (both regarding the biomass (OBS tjek om dette er rigtigt Thilde) and the psilocybin production). Furthermore, the required minimal yield in order to run a viable psilocybin manufacturing company is much smaller (maybe need to justify this with numbers, Thilde can make some numbers), making the small reduction in yield rather insignificant. \n",

    "The phenotype phase plane analysis not surprisingly revealed that there is a positive linear relationship between glucose content in the media and the biomass flux.The same applies for the relationship between the psiM reaction flux (producing psilocybin) and glucose, and so the glucose level in the media is kept at 20 (unit). (Skal der stå mere her? + skal jeg tjekke med nogle af aminosyrerne?) However, note that the media concentrations in the model might not reflect the actual concentrations in YEPD media made with a standard recipe."

    "#### Computation of co-factor swap targets:\n",
    "Cofactor swapping [NAD, NADH] for [NADP, NADPH] had no effect on psilocybin production. This is likely because precursor pathways leading to the production of the psilocybin precursor tryptophan require both NADH and NADPH.  However, if the model had been complete, then this cofactor swap would likely have been beneficial. The cytochrome P450 containing monooxygenase (PcPsiH) enzyme expressed in A. niger is required for the conversion of tryptamine to 4-hydroxytryptamine, and is dependent on cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) to reduce it to its active form. CPR transfers uses NADPH for electron transfer to PcPsiH, and therefore increasing the pool of available NADPH through cofactor swapping could potentially increase the rate of conversion of tryptamine to 4-hydroxytryptamine, and lead to higher psilocybin production.
